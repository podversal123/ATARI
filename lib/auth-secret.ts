 * Single source of truth for the session-signing key, used by both

 * request gate) - kept in its own file with no other imports so middleware

 *
 * Throwing on a missing secret (rather than encoding `undefined` into a
 * weak literal key) matters here specifically because middleware used to
 * inline this same check without the guard - a misconfigured deployment
 * missing AUTH_SECRET would have silently accepted any cookie signed with
 * the string "undefined" as a valid session instead of failing closed.
