 * Maps a Form Management leaf (its recordPath = URL slug segments joined by

 * that part (e.g. "2.2 On Farm Trial" with its 2.2.A / 2.2.B / 2.2.C tables)
 * - instead of a flat one-table export of just the list's own rows.
 *
 * `nums` are the subsection numbers in the two report trees (Super Admin and
 * the KVK-scoped variant share most numbering; a few section-5 subsections
 * differ, so more than one is listed). `titleIncludes` is an
 * order-independent title match used first, so a rename or a cross-tree
 * numbering drift still resolves. A subsection matches when its title
 * contains `titleIncludes` (case-insensitive) OR its number is in `nums`.
